This repo contains all the educational content that I've prepared

I'm using [Marp](https://marpit.marp.app) to create the presentations

After installing [Marp CLI](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli), you can check changes in real time by running the following command: 

`marp -s . --theme-set ./themes/`

If you you want to force any theme, add the argument `--theme`

`marp -s . --theme-set ./themes/ --theme my_theme`
